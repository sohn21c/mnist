## Objective  
To build a system to recognize hand-written digit on the paper with usb camera. Convolutional Neural Network model is to used to train the MNIST digit data set with Keras API with TensorFlow backend.  

## Video demonstration
The video below shows the demo of recognizing the hand-written number on the sticky with the usb camera.

## Software
### Convolutional Neural Network training  


CNN training model and the code structure is mostly based on the official tutorial of Keras API in [TensorFlow webpage](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification) distributed under MIT license. Neural Network composition differs from the training material to enhance the accuracy on top of the number of iterations being 10. One can find the model shown below.
