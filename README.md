## This project is on-going!

## Objective  
To build a system to recognize hand-written digit on the paper with usb camera. Convolutional Neural Network model is to be used to train the MNIST digit data set using Keras API with TensorFlow backend.  


## Software
CNN training model and the code structure is mostly based on the official tutorial of Keras API in [TensorFlow webpage](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification) distributed under MIT license. Neural Network composition differs from the training material to enhance the accuracy on top of the number of iterations being 10. One can find the model shown below.
